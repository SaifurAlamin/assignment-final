                <h4>Mission</h4>
                <p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals,
                    including an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and
                    JavaScript. Many aspiring Web Developers are now using coding bootcamps to fast-track the learning
                    process.

                <h4>Goals</h4>
                <p>The main objective when working as a developer is to be productive and deliver value to the company.
                    As a developer or a CTO, the aim is to build practical applications that will be 100% successful. To
                    achieve this, specific goals need to be set, which include enhancing my networking skills.And It's
                    my goal.</p>

            <h1>Extra Curricular</h1>
            <p>Extracurricular activities are hobbies and pursuits that don't fall within the scope of the traditional
                academic curriculum. More to the point, extracurriculars typically refer to organized, official
                activities and athletics for which students don't receive school credit.I have also some extra
                curricular activites.I am doing a job as a Network Engineer in a nationwide ISP for last 2 years.I am
                almost comfortable in this job.But now am trying to learn development.Now It's my goal.</p>
